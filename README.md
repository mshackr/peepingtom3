# Peepingtom3 is an old version of peepingtom that would work with python3.
This script is a Python 3 rewrite of the original script by [Tim Tomes]. The original script can be found at [https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/peepingtom/src/master/].
Update: the original script is no longer maintained. You are encouraged to explore alternatives. This one is just quick and dirty work.

## Changes Made
- Rewritten from Python 2 to Python 3.
- Added sorting.
- Upgraded phantomjs library (to run on apple silicon)

## Quick start
python3 ./peepingtom3.py -p -i urls.txt
